DOCUMENTATION

More detail can be found in Section 3.3 (Batch Mode) of the user manual

Parameter		Values		Description

BatchNum		≥ 0			Batch number, appears in all output file names

PatchModel		0 / 1		0 = cell-based model, 1 = patch-based model

Resolution		> 0			Landscape resolution, i.e. cell size (in m)

LandType		0 / 2 / 9	0 = imported raster map with unique habitat codes
							2 = imported raster map with habitat quality
							9 = create an artificial landscape for each replicate
						
MaxHabitats		> 0			Maximum number of habitats in the landscapes to be used;
							must be >1 for LandType = 0
							must be 1 for LandType = 2 or 9
						
SpeciesDist		0 / 1		Load initial species distribution? 0 = no, 1 = yes

DistResolution	> 0			Resolution of the species distribution map (m)
							must not be less than the Resolution parameter

Reproduction	0 / 1 / 2	0 = asexual / only female model, 1 = sexual model (simple);
							2 = sexual model (explicit mating system)

RepSeasons		≥ 1			No. of reproductive seasons per year

StageStruct		0 / 1		0 = no stage structure, 1 = stage-structured model

Stages			> 1			No. of stages (incl. juveniles) if stage-structured

Transfer		0 / 1 / 2	Transfer method: 0 = dispersal kernels,
							1 = SMS (stochastic movement simulator),
							2 = CRW (correlated random walk)

ParameterFile		filename			Principal file for model parameters,
										1 line per simulation, simulations must be numbered sequentially
										includes habitat-dependent values for K (or 1/b)
							
LandFile			filename			Identifies the landscape(s) to be used for each simulation in the ParametersFile; format depends on LandType setting

StageStructFile		filename/NULL		NULL if not stage-structured model (StageStruct= 0),
										must have matching simulation nos. to those in ParametersFile 
										1 line per simulation

EmigrationFile		filename			Must have matching simulation nos. to those in ParametersFile
										no. lines per simulation depends on model stage and sex structure

TransferFile		filename			Must have matching simulation nos. to those in ParametersFile
										no. lines per simulation depends on model stage and sex structure

SettlementFile		filename			Must have matching simulation nos. to those in ParametersFile
										no. lines per simulation depends on model stage and sex structure

GeneticsFile 		filename/NULL		Required if any dispersal trait is made evolvable (IndVar fields in Emigration/Transfer/Settlement files).

(v3.0) TraitsFile	filename/NULL		Required if any dispersal trait is made evolvable. 1 line per simulation; 
										1 line per trait type per simulation.

InitialisationFile	filename			Must have matching simulation nos. to those in ParametersFile.
										1 line per simulation
